Contains logic between [Ezno's parser](https://github.com/kaleidawave/ezno/tree/main/parser) and the checkers API.

If parsing is building abstract syntax tree from a string, synthesis is building types (and other information from abstract syntax tree)

This module is based on [Ezno's parser](https://github.com/kaleidawave/ezno/tree/main/parser), for bindings between Oxc's parser and Ezno check out [oxc_type_synthesis](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/oxc/tree/main/crates/oxc_type_synthesis).
