A JavaScript compiler and TypeScript checker written in Rust with a focus on static analysis and runtime performance.

> [!WARNING]
> Ezno is in active development and currently does not support enough features to check existing projects. Check out the [getting started guide](./checker/docs/getting-started.md) for experimenting with what it current [supports today](./checker/specification/specification.md).

What Ezno is
- A type checker for JavaScript, usable as a library or with *optional* compiler infrastructure (parser, CLI, LSP, etc)
- Fully typed programs, guaranteeing type safety (as long as definitions are sound)
- Types aimed at soundness and tracing for better static analysis
- A *imperative* type system, with event tracing and evaluating function side effects. Equivalent to an interpreter, but with types rather than values
- A collection of experiments of types. Many are being worked out and are in the prototype stage. Some behaviors are specific to JavaScript and others could be applied to other languages
- A challenge to the status quo of DCE, type checking, optimisations and compilation through deeper static analysis beyond syntax analysis
- [Checking available through other tools!]((https://github.com/web-infra-dev/oxc/tree/main/crates/oxc_type_synthesis))
- Written in Rust

What Ezno is not
- **eNZo, Z goes before the N** (pronounce as 'Fresno' without the 'fr') ðŸ˜€
- 1:1 / parity with TSC, it has different behaviors **but** should work in existing projects using TSC (check out [stc](https://github.com/dudykr/stc) that is aimed at 1:1)
- A binary executable generator. It takes in JavaScript (or TS/Ezno superset) and does similar methods to traditional compilers, but at the end emits JavaScript. However in future it could generate a lower level format using its event representation.

This project is a workspace consisting of a few crates:

| Crate | Lines Of Code | Contains |
|---|---|---|
| checker | ![checker lines of code](https://projects.kaleidawave.workers.dev/project/ezno-checker/badge) | Stores for types and contexts, type checking logic and optional synthesis over the parser AST |
| parser | ![parser lines of code](https://projects.kaleidawave.workers.dev/project/ezno-parser/badge) | AST definitions, logic for parsing, AST to string and visiting |
<!-- | ezno-web-framework | ![](https://projects.kaleidawave.workers.dev/project/framework/badge) | Visitors and code generation for JSX and reactive expression transformations. | -->
<!-- | ezno-lsp | ![](https://projects.kaleidawave.workers.dev/project/framework/badge) | Visitors and code generation for JSX and reactive expression transformations. | -->

Also checkout [oxc_type_synthesis](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/oxc/tree/main/crates/oxc_type_synthesis), a crate which allows using the type checker inside [oxc](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/oxc/tree/main)!
